# Rock-Paper-Scissors
The original game has a fairly small choice of options.
Extended versions of the game are decreasing the probability of a draw, so it could be cool to play them.
Now, program able to accept alternative lists of options, like Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock, or even an extended list. 
At this stage, before the start of the game, the user will be able to choose the options that will be used. 
After entering his/her name, the user should provide a list of options separated by a comma. For example, rock,paper,scissors,lizard,spock.
If the user inputs an empty line, program should start the game with default options: rock, paper, and scissors.
Whatever list of options the user chooses, program, obviously, should be able to identify which option beats which, that is, the relationships between different options.
First, every option is equal to itself (causing a draw if both the user and the computer choose the same option). 
Secondly, every option wins over one half of the other options of the list and gets defeated by another half.
